White Paper: Bitcoin Paper Wallet Generator

Introduction

A paper wallet is a physical representation of a Bitcoin private key, which can be used to store and manage Bitcoin offline. The purpose of this white paper is to describe a basic HTML and JavaScript paper wallet generator for Bitcoin, which can be used to create and print paper wallets for offline storage.

Design

The paper wallet generator is a simple web application that consists of an HTML page with a JavaScript script. The HTML page includes a button that, when clicked, generates a new Bitcoin address and private key pair using the JavaScript script. The generated address and private key are then displayed on the HTML page.

The JavaScript script uses the BitcoinJS library, which provides a set of cryptographic functions for generating and managing Bitcoin addresses and private keys. The script first generates a new private key using the library's "getNewAddress()" function. It then derives the corresponding public address from the private key using the library's "p2pkh" function.

The HTML page includes two div elements with the id's "addressDiv" and "privateKeyDiv", respectively. The JavaScript script uses the "innerHTML" property of these elements to display the generated address and private key on the HTML page.

Security

The paper wallet generator is designed to be used offline, as it does not transmit any sensitive information over the internet. However, it is important to note that the security of the paper wallet depends on the physical security of the printed paper and the computer used to generate the wallet. Therefore, it is recommended to use a clean and secure computer, and to store the printed paper in a safe place.

Conclusion

This white paper describes a basic HTML and JavaScript paper wallet generator for Bitcoin, which can be used to create and print paper wallets for offline storage. The generator uses the BitcoinJS library to generate a new private key and derive the corresponding public address, which are then displayed on an HTML page. The paper wallet generator is designed to be used offline, and it is important to ensure the physical security of the printed paper and the computer used to generate the wallet.
